BC-PMLP
=======
The source code of transfer learning for recommendation system.
Environment Settings
---------------------
# The general environment of the experiment is given as followsï¼š 

	Python 3.5
	torch 1.4.0
	some necessary packages.

# For each file in this folder, including code and data, we will give the following explanation:

	* Folder BC-PMLP: 
		Folder data: Store the feature vectors trained by BC and derived from SVD++ in the form of dictionary;
		Code BC_PMLP.py: Store the construction code of PMLP (called REG) and the prediction code of BC (called CLA);
		Code Dataset.py: Some data preprocessing functions. If you run this code directly, this function file will not work;
		Code run.py: There is a main function inside, which can be run directly;
		
	* Folder Data: One test data and one training data are stored in it. 
		    We do not provide the original data in the whole folder, but only the encoded and segmented processed data.
	* Folder SVD++: 
		Folder data: Representation vectors of all users and items trained from SVD++ algorithm is stored, which are also the input of BC-PMLP;
		Code SVD++.py: The source code of SVD++ algorithm, most of which comes from the Internet.

More details about the code are given in the form of comments in the code file.
